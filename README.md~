Output color highlighting for Maven 
==============================

It works by wrapping your Maven command and then inserting ANSI colour codes in the output.

Also added few aliases for short call.
* *mvnc* - for run "mvn" with color highlighting
* *mci* - for run "mvn clean install" with color highlighting

*Node:* any extra params for *mvnc* will proxy as params for *mvn*

To install
------------------------

* Put the file in a handy directory (like _~/.aliases_) *add* a link to it in your _.bashrc_ (or other shell's initialization file)
* *Or* run the folowing bash scripts to do automaticly

```bash
mkdir -p ${HOME}/.aliases # make a place for the script to live 
wget https://github.com/banadiga/maven-color/blob/master/maven-color.sh ${HOME}/.aliases # download last version
echo "[[ -s \"${HOME}/.aliases/maven-color.sh\" ]] && source \"${HOME}/.aliases/maven-color.sh\"" >> ${HOME}/bashrc # add to RC file
. ${HOME}/bashrc # to re-read your bash configuration
```


To update
